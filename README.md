# FileDb
In this project, we used the Design Pattern principles to read and write information to JSON and TXT files according to the norms, and the program was brought to the library view.
<br>

> I have applied the ``Design Patterns`` I learned in this project and I am following a clear structure in my program.
``SOLID`` principles and ``Dependency Injection, Dependency Inversion`` and ``Singleton Patterns`` are featured prominently
in my program. You can learn how I used these principles in my ``FileDb``project in the sections below.

## How the FileDB project works?
The **FileDB** project allows us to work with ***TXT*** or ***JSON*** files.
